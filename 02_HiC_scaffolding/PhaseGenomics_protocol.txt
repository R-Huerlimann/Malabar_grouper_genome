HiC scaffolding protocol used by Phase Genomics

Chromatin conformation capture data was generated using a Phase Genomics (Seattle, WA) Proximo Hi-C 4.0 Kit, which is a commercially available version of the Hi-C protocol [1]. 
Following the manufacturer's instructions for the kit, intact cells from two samples were crosslinked using a formaldehyde solution, digested using the DPNII restriction enzyme, 
and proximity ligated with biotinylated nucleotides to create chimeric molecules composed of fragments from different regions of the genome that were physically proximal in vivo,
but not necessarily genomically proximal. Continuing with the manufacturer's protocol, molecules were pulled down with streptavidin beads and processed into an Illumina-compatible 
sequencing library. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 4000, generating a total of 159,606,973 read pairs.
Reads were aligned to the draft assembly also following the manufacturer's recommendations [2]. Briefly, reads were aligned using BWA-MEM[3] with the -5SP and -t 8 options specified,
and all other options default. SAMBLASTER[4] was used to flag PCR duplicates, which were later excluded from analysis. Alignments were then filtered with samtools[5] using 
the -F 2304 filtering flag to remove non-primary and secondary alignments. FALCON-Phase[6] was used to correct likely phase switching errors in the primary contigs and alternate 
haplotigs from FALCON-Unzip and output its results in pseudohap format, creating one complete set of contigs for each phase.
Phase Genomics' Proximo Hi-C genome scaffolding platform was used to create chromosome-scale scaffolds from FALCON-Phase's phase 0 assembly, following the same single-phase 
scaffolding procedure described in Bickhart et al. [7]. As in the LACHESIS method [8], this process computes a contact frequency matrix from the aligned Hi-C read pairs, normalized
by the number of DPNII restriction sites (GATC) on each contig, and constructs scaffolds in such a way as to optimize expected contact frequency and other statistical patterns 
in Hi-C data.

Juicebox[9,10] was then used to correct scaffolding errors, and FALCON-Phase was run a second time to detect and correct phase switching errors that were not detectable at the 
contig level, but which were detectable at the chromosome-scaffold level. Metadata generated by FALCON-Phase about scaffold phasing was used to generate matching .assembly files 
(a file format used by Juicebox) and subsequently used to produce a diploid, fully-phased, chromosome-scale set of scaffolds using a purpose-built script[11]. In these final scaffolds,
phase 0 included 24 scaffolds spanning 1,027,591,625 bp (92.82% of input) with a scaffold N50 of 43,313,630 bp, and phase 1 included 24 scaffolds spanning 1,019,278,383 bp 
(91.98% of input) with a scaffold N50 of 43,164,609 bp.
